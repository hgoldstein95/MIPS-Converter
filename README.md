# MIPS-Converter
A simple converter from MIPS Assembly instructions to bytecode (in binary).

## Usage
Simply run:
```
ruby mips_convert.rb [filename]
```

Optionally, add an output file:
```
ruby mips_convert.rb [filename] > [output file]
```

## Disclaimer
This is simply a test tool I threw together for one of my classes. I make no guarantees that it does not have bugs. Also, this has **not** been tested with BRANCH operations yet.
